## Client personality
French, WhatsApp, friendly, replies a day late sometimes, very careful with money, wants step by step, wants subscription back, plans to reinvest app income.

## Problems solved (for future builds)
1. Base44 ZIP download needed Builder plan and GitHub sync
2. Codemagic "No configuration file found": files must be at repo root
3. "No matching profiles": use fetch-signing-files --create with a generated cert key, no ios_signing
4. 401 from Apple API: re-enter App Store Connect key in Codemagic Integrations
5. External TestFlight failure: submit_to_testflight false (Beta App Information and review contact empty)
6. Resubmit button grey: edit notes and save, refresh, Add for Review, or build 15 as backup

## OPEN ITEMS (ask Abdulwasiu)
1. Payment: Amazigh wants to pay by Sendwave to his OPay account. Not confirmed what it covers (approval job or step 2) or whether the Fiverr or Upwork contract is open. Off platform payment can break platform rules and remove escrow protection. His Fiverr account was blocked once. Recommendation: keep payment on the platform. If he chooses off platform anyway: confirm amount and what it covers in writing first. Sendwave needs only: full name as on OPay, OPay account number, bank OPay, country Nigeria, phone number. Never share a password, PIN, OTP or BVN
2. Was the step 2 message sent? Her step 2 budget
3. Was the approval job delivered, accepted, reviewed on platform
4. Ask her to revoke the App Store Connect API key now that the app is published
5. The two earlier Apple rejection messages were not checked for other reasons
6. Approval job price, deposit, unpaid amount not recorded
7. Who is "Samuel Marvelous" in App Store Connect
8. Real live Base44 link (zips contain a placeholder)
